To add a remote repository named "origin" with the specified URL (https://github.com/user/files.git) to a Git project. 
This establishes a connection between the local repository 
and the remote repository on GitHub, allowing you to push and pull changes between them. The term "origin" is a conventional name often given to the default remote repository.
git remote add origin https://github.com/crystgandhi/MyJavaFiles.git
------------------------------------------
to push the local branch named "main" to the remote repository (usually on GitHub) that is set as "origin."
