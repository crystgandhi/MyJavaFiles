// rename the current branch to "main" in a Git repository
git branch -M main
to add a remote repository named "origin" with the specified URL (https://github.com/user/files.git) to a Git project. This establishes a connection between the local repository 
and the remote repository on GitHub, allowing you to push and pull changes between them. The term "origin" is a conventional name often given to the default remote repository.
git remote add origin https://github.com/crystgandhi/MyJavaFiles.git
to push the local branch named "main" to the remote repository (usually on GitHub) that is set as "origin." 
The -u flag is used to set up tracking, linking the local branch with the remote branch, which allows for more straightforward future Git operations. 
After this command, subsequent pushes or pulls can be performed without specifying the remote and branch names.
git push -u origin main
